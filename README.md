1) Sender’s Email Address

Appears as support@secure-banking-alerts.com
.

Legitimate banks use official domains (e.g., @bankname.com).

The domain looks suspicious and is not a real bank domain → spoofing attempt.

2) Suspicious Links

Visible link: http://secure.yourbank.com/login

Real link (on hover): http://securebanking-verification123.co/login

Mismatched URL → phishing tactic.

3) Attachments

No attachment in this case, but phishing emails often include malicious PDFs, ZIPs, or Word files.

4) Urgent/Threatening Language

“If you do not verify within 24 hours, your account will be permanently locked.”

Creates fear and urgency → classic social engineering trick.

5) Grammar/Spelling Errors

Sentence structure is slightly unnatural: “We detected unusual activity” followed by “permanently locked” without proper phrasing.

Minor grammar inconsistencies common in phishing emails.ails.
